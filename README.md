# Time in Python
This program executes the time entered by the user and the minutes, showing on the screen whether it is A.M. or P.M. In addition to having two time format options, one being 12 hours and the other 24 hours.

-> I added two code options, one being easier to view due to the codes being in color
- More complete file name: horario.py         // Made with 'def' and has the import time,sys,os for animation purposes
- More simplified file name: horarioEasy.py   // Made only with 'def'
